## Setup

<small>Next section: [Database](#database)</small>

### Installation

To get started, install the integration of your chosen framework.

<Code>
  <Code.Next>
    
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install next-auth@beta
    ```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Qwik>

    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm run qwik add auth
    ```

  </Code.Qwik>
  <Code.Svelte>
  
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install @auth/sveltekit
    ```
  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>
  
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install @auth/express
    ```
  
  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Environment

The only required environment variable is `AUTH_SECRET`. You can use the [Auth.js CLI](https://cli.authjs.dev) to generate one:

```bash
npx auth secret # run this in the root of your project, it will add the secret to your .env file
```

All other environment variable is optional. Continue reading to learn about when and how to use them.

### Configuration

To use Auth.js, you need to create a [configuration](/reference/core#authconfig). This file is where you define your authentication providers, callbacks, and other settings.

If you are using [OAuth](#oauth), want to render default pages, need [email](#email) verification, or want to interact with Auth.js from the browser via `fetch`, your app needs to
expose some public REST API endpoints. Auth.js handles all this for you by setting up the necessary routes which is specific for each framework integration.

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export const { handlers } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
})
```

```ts filename="app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
import { handlers } from "@/auth"
export const { GET, POST } = handlers
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Qwik>

```ts filename="src/routes/plugin@auth.ts"
import { QwikAuth$ } from "@auth/qwik"

export const { onRequest, useSession, useSignIn, useSignOut } = QwikAuth$(
  () => ({
    providers: [...],
  })
)
```

  </Code.Qwik>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="src/auth.ts"
import { SvelteKitAuth } from "@auth/sveltekit"

export const { handle } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [],
})
```

```ts filename="src/hooks.server.ts"
export { handle } from "./auth"
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="src/routes/auth.route.ts"
import { ExpressAuth } from "@auth/express"
import express from "express"

const app = express()
app.set("trust proxy", true) // Read: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html
app.use(
  "/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({
    providers: [],
  })
)
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

## Database

<small>Next section: [Authentication methods](#authentication-methods)</small>

<Callout type="info">
  This section is optional. [Skip to the next section](#authentication-methods)
  if you're using a provider that doesn't require a database, or you don't need
  to persist any user data. (I.e you only need the user to log in.)
</Callout>

To connect Auth.js Choose a database adapter from the list below, or if you don't see one for your database or service, you can also create your own. Have a look at our guide on [connecting to a database](/guides/creating-a-database-adapter).

<div>
  {Object.entries(manifest.adapters).map(([value, label]) => (
    <Link
      href={`/getting-started/adapters/${value}`}
      key={value}
      className="m-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md border-neutral-200 p-2 transition-colors duration-300 hover:bg-neutral-200 dark:hover:bg-neutral-600"
    >
      <img
        className="light:bg-white inline h-4 w-4 drop-shadow-sm"
        src={`/img/adapters/${value}.svg`}
      />
      <span className="text-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap text-sm">{label}</span>
    </Link>
  ))}
</div>

## Authentication methods

<small>Next section: [Signing in](#signing-in)</small>

<Callout type="info">
You can also use the [Auth.js CLI tool](https://cli.authjs.dev) to set up a provider in your project.

```bash
npx auth add [provider]
```

</Callout>

### OAuth

Choose an OAuth/OIDC provider to enable social logins.
To enable social logins/SSO, choose an OAuth/OIDC provider from the list below, or if you don't see your provider, you can also create one. Have a look at our guide on [connecting a custom OAuth provider](/guides/configuring-oauth-providers#use-your-own-provider).

<OAuthProviderSelect />

<Callout type="info">
  Auth.js supports using the same OAuth client on multiple domains. Learn more
  in the [Deployment](#securing-multiple-deployments) section.
</Callout>

### Email

This login mechanism starts by the user providing their email address at the login form. Then a **Verification Token** is sent to the provided email address. The user then has 24 hours to click the link in the email body to "consume" that token and register their account, otherwise the verification token will expire and they will have to request a new one.

<Callout>
  An Email Provider can be used with both [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) and
  [database](/concepts/session-strategies#database-session) session, but
  **configuring a database** is necessary so that Auth.js can save the
  verification tokens and look them up when the user attempts to login.
</Callout>

### WebAuthn

<Callout type="warning">
  The WebAuthn/Passkeys provider is currently experimental and not supported by
  all framework integrations yet.
</Callout>

**Install peer dependencies**

This provider requires the `@simplewebauthn/server` and `@simplewebauthn/browser` packages to be installed.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @simplewebauthn/server@9.0.3 @simplewebauthn/browser@9.0.1
```

The `@simplewebauthn/browser` peer dependency **is only required for custom signin pages**. If you're using the Auth.js default pages, you can skip installing that peer dependency.

**Apply the required schema Migrations**

This is the raw SQL migration for PostgreSQL, for more details including example migrations for other databases, check out the updated Prisma schemas at the [`@auth/prisma-adapter` docs](/getting-started/adapters/prisma).

In short, the Passkeys provider requires an additional table called `Authenticator`.

```sql filename="./migration/add-webauthn-authenticator-table.sql"
-- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE "Authenticator" (
    "credentialID" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "userId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "providerAccountId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "credentialPublicKey" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "counter" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "credentialDeviceType" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "credentialBackedUp" BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    "transports" TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY ("userId", "credentialID"),
    CONSTRAINT "Authenticator_userId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "User" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);


-- CreateIndex
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Authenticator_credentialID_key" ON "Authenticator"("credentialID");
```

**Update Auth.js Configuration**

Add the `Passkeys` provider to your configuration. Also make sure you're using a compatible database adapter.

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import Passkey from "next-auth/providers/passkey"
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export default {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [Passkey],
  experimental: { enableWebAuthn: true },
}
```

If you're using the built-in Auth.js pages, then you are good to go! Navigating to your `/signin` route should include a "Signin with Passkeys" button.

**Custom Pages**

If you're using a custom signin page, you can leverage the `next-auth` `signIn` function to initiate WebAuthn registration and login flows with the following code.

<Callout>
  When using the WebAuthn `signIn` function, you'll also need the
  `@simplewebauth/browser` peer dependency installed.
</Callout>

```ts filename="app/login/page.tsx"
"use client"

import { useSession } from "next-auth/react"
import { signIn } from "next-auth/webauthn"

export default function Login() {
  const { data: session, update, status } = useSession()

  return (
    <div>
      {status === "authenticated" ? (
        <button onClick={() => signIn("passkey", { action: "register" })}>
          Register new Passkey
        </button>
      ) : status === "unauthenticated" ? (
        <button onClick={() => signIn("passkey")}>Sign in with Passkey</button>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Custom

To setup Auth.js with any external authentication mechanisms or use a traditional username/email and password flow, we can use the `Credentials` provider. This provider is designed to forward any credentials inserted into the login form (i.e. username/password, but not limited to) to your authentication service.

<Callout type="warning">
  The industry has come a long way since usernames and passwords
  as the go-to mechanism for authenticating and authorizing users to
  web applications. Therefore, if possible, we recommend a more modern and
  secure authentication mechanism such as any of the [OAuth
  providers](/getting-started/authentication/oauth), [Email Magic
  Links](/getting-started/authentication/email), or [WebAuthn
  (Passkeys)](/getting-started/authentication/webauthn) options instead.

However, we also want to be flexible and support anything
you deem appropriate for your application and use case,
so there are no plans to remove this provider.

</Callout>

<Callout>
  By default, the Credentials provider does not persist data in the database.
  However, you can still create and save any data in your database, you just
  have to provide the necessary logic, eg. to encrypt passwords, add
  rate-limiting, add password reset functionality, etc.
</Callout>

<Steps>

**Credentials Provider**

First, let's initialize the `Credentials` provider in the Auth.js configuration file. You'll have to import the provider and add it to your `providers` array.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts" {2, 8}
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
// Your own logic for dealing with plaintext password strings; be careful!
import { saltAndHashPassword } from "@/utils/password"

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      // You can specify which fields should be submitted, by adding keys to the `credentials` object.
      // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
      credentials: {
        email: {},
        password: {},
      },
      authorize: async (credentials) => {
        let user = null

        // logic to salt and hash password
        const pwHash = saltAndHashPassword(credentials.password)

        // logic to verify if the user exists
        user = await getUserFromDb(credentials.email, pwHash)

        if (!user) {
          // No user found, so this is their first attempt to login
          // Optionally, this is also the place you could do a user registration
          throw new Error("Invalid credentials.")
        }

        // return user object with their profile data
        return user
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.Qwik>
  
```ts filename="/src/routes/plugin@auth.ts"
import { QwikAuth$ } from "@auth/qwik"
import Credentials from "@auth/qwik/providers/credentials"

export const { onRequest, useSession, useSignIn, useSignOut } = QwikAuth$(
  () => ({
    providers: [
      Credentials({
        credentials: {
          email: { label: "Email" },
          password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
        },
        async authorize(credentials) {
          const response = await getUserFromDb(credentials)
          if (!response.ok) return null
          return (await response.json()) ?? null
        },
      }),
    ],
  })
)
```

</Code.Qwik>
<Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="./src/auth.ts" {2, 8}
import { SvelteKitAuth } from "@auth/sveltekit"
import Credentials from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/credentials"
// Your own logic for dealing with plaintext password strings; be careful!
import { saltAndHashPassword } from "@/utils/password"

export const { signIn, signOut, handle } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      // You can specify which fields should be submitted, by adding keys to the `credentials` object.
      // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
      credentials: {
        email: {},
        password: {},
      },
      authorize: async (credentials) => {
        let user = null

        // logic to salt and hash password
        const pwHash = saltAndHashPassword(credentials.password)

        // logic to verify if user exists
        user = await getUserFromDb(credentials.email, pwHash)

        if (!user) {
          // No user found, so this is their first attempt to login
          // Optionally, this is also the place you could do a user registration
          throw new Error("Invalid credentials.")
        }

        // return JSON object with the user data
        return user
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

Don't forget to re-export the `handle` in your `./src/hooks.server.ts` file.

```ts filename="./src/hooks.server.ts"
export { handle } from "./auth"
```

</Code.Svelte>

<Code.Express>

```ts filename="./src/routes/auth.route.ts" {2, 11}
import { ExpressAuth } from "@auth/express"
import Credentials from "@auth/express/providers/credentials"
import express from "express"
// Your own logic for dealing with plaintext password strings; be careful!
import { saltAndHashPassword } from "@/utils/password"

const app = express()
app.use(
  "/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({
    providers: [
      Credentials({
        // You can specify which fields should be submitted, by adding keys to the `credentials` object.
        // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
        credentials: {
          email: {},
          password: {},
        },
        authorize: async (credentials) => {
          let user = null

          // logic to salt and hash password
          const pwHash = saltAndHashPassword(credentials.password)

          // logic to verify if the user exists
          user = await getUserFromDb(credentials.email, pwHash)

          if (!user) {
            // No user found, so this is their first attempt to login
            // Optionally, this is also the place you could do a user registration
            throw new Error("Invalid credentials.")
          }

          // return user object with the their profile data
          return user
        },
      }),
    ],
  })
)
```

</Code.Express>
</Code>

<Callout type="info">
  If you're using TypeScript, you can [augment the `User`
  interface](/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation) to match the
  response of your `authorize` callback, so whenever you read the user in other
  callbacks (like the `jwt`) the type will match correctly.
</Callout>

**Signin Form**

Finally, let's create a simple sign-in form.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="./components/sign-in.tsx" {13, 17} /formData/
import { signIn } from "@/auth"

export function SignIn() {
  return (
    <form
      action={async (formData) => {
        "use server"
        await signIn("credentials", formData)
      }}
    >
      <label>
        Email
        <input name="email" type="email" />
      </label>
      <label>
        Password
        <input name="password" type="password" />
      </label>
      <button>Sign In</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.NextClient>

```tsx filename="./components/sign-in.tsx"
"use client"
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react"

export function SignIn() {
  const credentialsAction = (formData: FormData) => {
    signIn("credentials", formData)
  }

  return (
    <form action={credentialsAction}>
      <label htmlFor="credentials-email">
        Email
        <input type="email" id="credentials-email" name="email" />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor="credentials-password">
        Password
        <input type="password" id="credentials-password" name="password" />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Sign In" />
    </form>
  )
}
```

</Code.NextClient>
<Code.Qwik>

```ts filename="/src/routes/index.tsx"
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Form } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"
import { useSignIn } from "./plugin@auth"

export default component$(() => {
  const signInSig = useSignIn()

  return (
    <Form action={signInSig}>
      <label>
        Email
        <input name="email" type="email" />
      </label>
      <label>
        Password
        <input name="password" type="password" />
      </label>
      <button>Sign In</button>
    </Form>
  )
})
```

</Code.Qwik>
<Code.Svelte>

```svelte filename="src/route/+page.svelte" /bind:value/ /signIn/
<script>
  import { signIn } from "../auth"
  import { page } from "$app/stores"

  let email = ""
  let password = ""
</script>

<div>
  <form>
    <label>
      Email
      <input name="email" type="email" bind:value={email} />
    </label>
    <label>
      Password
      <input name="password" type="password" bind:value={password} />
    </label>
    <button on:click={() => signIn("credentials", { email, password })}>
      Log in
    </button>
  </form>
</div>
```

</Code.Svelte>

<Code.Express>

```html filename="views/signin.html"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

      <br />
      <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

</Code.Express>

</Code>

</Steps>

**Validating credentials**

Always validate the credentials server-side, i.e. by leveraging a schema validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev).

```bash npm2yarn
npm install zod
```

Next, we'll set up the schema and parsing in our `auth.ts` configuration file, using the `authorize` callback on the `Credentials` provider.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./lib/zod.ts"
import { object, string } from "zod"

export const signInSchema = object({
  email: string({ required_error: "Email is required" })
    .min(1, "Email is required")
    .email("Invalid email"),
  password: string({ required_error: "Password is required" })
    .min(1, "Password is required")
    .min(8, "Password must be more than 8 characters")
    .max(32, "Password must be less than 32 characters"),
})
```

```ts filename="./auth.ts" {22}
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import { ZodError } from "zod"
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
import { signInSchema } from "./lib/zod"
// Your own logic for dealing with plaintext password strings; be careful!
import { saltAndHashPassword } from "@/utils/password"
import { getUserFromDb } from "@/utils/db"

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      // You can specify which fields should be submitted, by adding keys to the `credentials` object.
      // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
      credentials: {
        email: {},
        password: {},
      },
      authorize: async (credentials) => {
        try {
          let user = null

          const { email, password } = await signInSchema.parseAsync(credentials)

          // logic to salt and hash password
          const pwHash = saltAndHashPassword(password)

          // logic to verify if the user exists
          user = await getUserFromDb(email, pwHash)

          if (!user) {
            throw new Error("Invalid credentials.")
          }

          // return JSON object with the user data
          return user
        } catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof ZodError) {
            // Return `null` to indicate that the credentials are invalid
            return null
          }
        }
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

          if (error instanceof ZodError) {
            // Return `null` to indicate that the credentials are invalid

Auth.js is fully type-safe and written in TypeScript.

**Our Philosophy**

We use [module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation)
over [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) to type Auth.js. These types can be used across the Auth.js submodules and libraries and your application
without passing around generics.

<details>
<summary>
<b>Why not use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html">generics</a>?</b>
</summary>
The interfaces that are shared across submodules are not passed to Auth.js library functions as generics.

Whenever these types are used, the functions always expect to return these formats. With generics, one might be able to override the type in one place, but not the other, which would cause the types to be out of sync with the implementation.

With module augmentation, you defined the types once, and you can be sure that they are always the same where it's expected.

</details>

**Module Augmentation**

Common interfaces to augment are `Session`, `User`, `Account` or `JWT`. To extend these types, let's look at extending `Session` for example.

<Callout type="info">
  The module declaration can be added to any file that is
  ["included"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include) in your
  project&apos;s `tsconfig.json`.

   */
  interface Session {
    user: {
      /** The user's postal address. */
      address: string
      /**
       * By default, TypeScript merges new interface properties and overwrites existing ones.
       * In this case, the default session user properties will be overwritten,
       * with the new ones defined above. To keep the default session user properties,
       * you need to add them back into the newly declared interface.

    } & DefaultSession["user"]
  }
}

export const { auth, handlers } = NextAuth({

## Deployment

<small>Next section: [Observability](#observability)</small>

**Environment Variables**

You are ready to deploy your app! The first thing you need to do is to set up your environment variables.

- Generate a different `AUTH_SECRET` for production. You can use the Auth.js CLI:

```bash
npx auth secret # save this as `AUTH_SECRET` in your production environment
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can rotate your secret without invalidating active sessions, by setting
  `AUTH_SECRET_1`, `AUTH_SECRET_AUTH_2` and `AUTH_SECRET_3`. The lowest number
  will be preferred.
</Callout>

The following are all _optional_ environment variables, depending on your use case and setup:

- `AUTH_URL`: If you host from behind a reverse proxy, or a custom path, set this to a full URL - including the path up until your REST API handlers, eg.: `/api/auth`.
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`: Set to `true` so Auth.js can trust the hosting provider to santizize the `host`, `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers.

  Auth.js will try to detect the if you host on a trustable hosting provider, in which case you don't need to set this variable. Currently Vercel (`VERCEL`) and Cloudflare (`CF_PAGES`) are supported,
  but we are open to adding more. Reach out to us if you want to add support for your hosting provider automatically.

- `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL`: See [Securing a multiple deployments](#securing-multiple-deployments) for more information.

  Providers relying on `response_mode=form_post` (like Apple) do not support this setting.

- OAuth Providers:

  If you are using an [OAuth Provider](/concepts/oauth), your provider will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you will need to set as environment variables as well (in the case of an OIDC provider, like Auth0, a third `issuer` value might be also required, refer to the provider's specific documentation).

<Callout type="info">
The following is not required, but if you call the environment variables with the following syntax, Auth.js will pick them up automatically.

Client ID's and client secrets should be named `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_ID` and `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_SECRET`. If your provider requires an issuer, that should be named `AUTH_[PROVIDER]_ISSUER`. For example:

```bash
AUTH_OKTA_ID=abc
AUTH_OKTA_SECRET=abc
AUTH_OKTA_ISSUER=abc
```

For more information, check out our [environment variables](/guides/environment-variables) page.

</Callout>

### Serverless

1. Create the required [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your desired environments. Don't forget to also add the required environment variables for your provider(s) of choice (i.e. OAuth `clientId` / `clientSecret`, etc.).
2. When using an OAuth provider, make sure the callback URL for your production URL is setup correctly. Many OAuth providers will only allow you to set one `callbackUrl` per OAuth application. In which case, you'll need to create separate applications for each environment (development, production, etc.). Other providers, like Google, allow you to add many `callbackUrl`s to one application.
   - Callback URls have the following format by default `https://company.com/auth/callback/[provider]` (replace `company.com` with your domain and `provider` with the provider name, i.e. `github`).
   - `next-auth` (Next.js) applications should look something like this: will use the path `/api/auth/callback/[provider]` by default for backwards compatibility.
3. Deploy! You should now be able to deploy and run your Auth.js application on any serverless platform and have it work as expected.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are storing users in a [database](/getting-started/database), we
  recommend using a different OAuth app for development/production so that you
  don't mix your test and production user base.
</Callout>

### Self-hosted

Auth.js can also be deployed anywhere you can deploy your framework of choice.

- Docker: In a Docker environment, make sure to set either `trustHost: true` in your Auth.js configuration or the `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` environment variable to `true`.

We have an example application running in Docker [here](https://nextjs-docker-example.authjs.dev), (see the [source code](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example)). Below is an example `Dockerfile` for a Next.js application using Auth.js.

````bash

```docker filename="Dockerfile"

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed

### Securing multiple deployments

A common use case is to have OAuth apps configured on multiple URLs like subdomains, or preview URLs. OAuth providers in general cannot be configured to allow multiple callback URLs or using a wildcard.

This is a security feature to accidentally allowing a malicious actor to redirect the user to a subdomain they control, for example.

However, Auth.js **supports multiple deployments** even with **OAuth providers**. It is achieved by configuring a deployment which proxies authentication requests to the dynamic URLs of your main application. So you could have 1 stable deployment, like at `auth.company.com` where you would point all your OAuth provider's `callbackUrl`s, and this application would then, upon successful authentication, redirect the user back to the preview deploy URL, like `https://git-abc123-myapp.vercel.app`. Follow these steps to get started with securing preview deploys with Auth.js.

Here is how to achieve this:

1. Determine a stable deployment URL. For example, a deployment whose URL does not change between builds, for example. `auth.yourdomain.com` (using a subdomain is not a requirement, this can be the main site's URL too, for example.)
2. Set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` in all deployments to the stable URL, including the path from where Auth.js handles the routes. Eg.: (`https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth`).
3. Point the callback/redirect URL in your OAuth provider's configuration to use the stable deployment URL. For example, for GitHub it would be `https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github`.
4. Make sure that `AUTH_SECRET` is the same for all deployments that need to support the same OAuth credentials

<details>
<summary>
<b>How does this work?</b>
</summary>
To support multiple deployments, Auth.js requires a deployment URL that is stable across deploys as a redirect proxy server.

It will redirect the OAuth callback request to the stable deployment URL, but only when the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable is set.

When a user initiates an OAuth sign-in flow on a configured deployment URL, it saves its URL in the `state` - encrypted - query parameter but set the `redirect_uri` to the stable deployment.

Then, the OAuth provider will redirect the user to the stable URL mentioned above, which will verify the `state` parameter and redirect the user to the original URL if the `state` is valid. This is secured by relying on the same server-side `AUTH_SECRET` for the stable deployment and the other deployments.

## Observability

<small>Next section: [Congratulations](#congratulations)</small>

**Logging**

By default, Auth.js will only log [errors](/errors) and [warnings](/warnings) to the console.

To enable debugging with more verbose information during the auth process, set the `debug` option.

```ts filename="auth.ts"
{
  // TIP: Set process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
  // - or the equivalent in non-Node.js runtimes -
  // to enable debug mode during development.
  debug: true
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Enabling debugging in production can lead to sensitive information being
  logged. Therefore, we only recommend enabling it for a short period,
  otherwise, make sure to properly santizize the logs via the `logger` option.
</Callout>

Customize the logging output by providing a `logger`. It can be partial object.

This lets you send logs to an external service, or customize the format of the logs.

```ts filename="auth.ts"
import { log } from "logging-service"

{
  logger: {
    error(code, ...message) {
      log.error(code, message)
    },
    warn(code, ...message) {
      log.warn(code, message)
    },
    debug(code, ...message) {
      log.debug(code, message)
    }
  }
}
```

When `logger` options are set, the `debug` option is ignored. You can also provide a partial logger object, only providing the methods you want to override.
